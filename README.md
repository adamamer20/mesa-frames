# mesa-frames
 `mesa-frames` is an extension of the [`mesa`](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa) designed for complex simulations with thousands of agents. By storing agents in a Pandas dataframe, `mesa-frames` significantly enhances the performance and scalability of `mesa`, while mantaining a similar syntax.  `mesa-frames` allows for the use of [vectorized functions](https://vegibit.com/what-is-a-vectorized-operation-in-pandas/) whenever simultaneous activation of agents is possible.

## Why Pandas?
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a popular data-manipulation Python library, developed using C and Cython. Pandas it's known both for its ease of use, allowing for declarative programming and performance. The following is a performance graph showing execution time using `mesa` and `mesa-frames` for the [Boltzmann Wealth model](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/intro_tutorial.html).

## Usage
NOTE: `mesa-frames` is currently in its early stages of development. As such, the usage patterns and API are subject to change. Breaking changes may be introduced. Reports of feedback and issues are encouraged.

You can find the API documentation [here](https://adamamer20.github.io/mesa-frames/api)

### Creation of the model

Creation of the model is fairly similar to the process in `mesa`. 
A new method [`create_agents`](https://github.com/adamamer20/mesa_frames/blob/main/mesa_frames/model.py#L131) is introduced which substitutes the addition of agents to the scheduler.
The [`run_model`](https://github.com/adamamer20/mesa_frames/blob/main/mesa_frames/model.py#L71) method also accepts the number of steps which the model has run.

```python
from mesa_frames.model import ModelDF
from mesa_frames.agent import AgentDF

class MyModel(ModelDF):
    def __init__(self, N):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_agents = N
        self.create_agents(N, {MyAgent: 1})
```

### Creation of an agent
The agent implementation differs from base `mesa`. Agents are only defined at the class level.
The `dtypes` dictionary attribute defines the name and data types of the new columns that will be added to the MyModel.agents dataframe during the execution `create_agents`.
All methods of an `AgentDF` should be class methods and every operation within class methods should operate on the `cls.model.agents` DataFrame, filtering by the class's mask initialized during the execution of `create_agents`. The step method is defined for the entire class.

```python
from mesa_frames.agent import AgentDF

class MyAgent(AgentDF):
    dtypes: dict[str, str] = {"wealth": "int64"}

    @classmethod
    def __init__(cls):
        super().__init__()
        #The next line sets the wealth attribute of all agents that are type MyAgent to 1
        cls.model.agents.loc[cls.mask, "wealth"] = 1

    @classmethod
    def step(cls):
        wealthy_agents = cls.model.agents.loc[cls.mask, "wealth"] > 0
        if wealthy_agents.any():
            #The next line finds the mask of a random sample of agents which is of the same length as wealthy agents
            other_agents = cls.model.agents.index.isin(
                cls.model.agents.sample(n=wealthy_agents.sum()).index
            )
            cls.model.agents.loc[wealthy_agents, "wealth"] -= 1
            cls.model.agents.loc[other_agents, "wealth"] += 1

```
## What's Next?
- Refine the API to make it more understandable for someone who is already familiar with the `mesa` package. The goal is to provide a seamless experience for users transitioning to or incorporating `mesa-frames`.
- Adding support for default `mesa` functions, ensure that the standard mesa functionality is preserved.
- Adding support for or shifting to `polars` instead of pandas. This change aims to boost performance and decrease memory consumption, which is crucial for models with milions of agents.
- Creating a decorator that will automatically vectorize an existing mesa model. This feature will allow users to easily tap into the performance enhancements that mesa-frames offers without significant code alterations.
